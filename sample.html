	<p>I personally used Koinex. </p>
	<p>I have accounts in Zebpay and I feel Koinex is the pretty good in terms of Trading and work of their Support team.</p>
	<p>This is a new website operating on a beta version but it is now very stable.</p> 
	<p>It has lowest difference in selling and buying price around 500 to 1000 Rs as compared to Zebpay which has difference of around 30,000 INR which is very high (which means very less loss and high profit).</p>
